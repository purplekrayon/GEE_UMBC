GES 4xx: Introduction to GEE for geographers
short decription:xxx

## Week 1.	What is GEE?
* GEE is a cloud computing platform with access to massive data archives. Anyone with a web browser can run analyses on data archives without computing capacity, data storage, and internet bandwidth restrictions
* [Google Earth Engine Tutorial from a non remote sensing specialist (11 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHtehTSw7vg)
* [intro video (90 min)](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials#introduction-to-earth-engine-condensed)
* What data are on GEE?  
 * Landsat & Sentinel, MODIS, VIIRS, Terra Bella, land cover, weather and climate
 * [view datasets](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/)
